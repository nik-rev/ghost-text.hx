We use `log` crate for logging. To activate it, uncomment the following line in `ghost-text.scm`:

```scm
; (Server::init_logging)
```

It will create an `out.log` file when you launch Helix with the Ghost Text.

You will need to install the plugin again, or just copy it to `~/.steel/cogs/ghost-text/ghost-text.scm`
